# Pomodoro

Doing the project in .tsx was a challange with compiling it and learning it but it was fun.

The program will be published in Javascript but to run the .tsx live while coding type:
npx esbuild src/main.tsx --bundle --outfile=main.js --watch
npx live-server dist (optional but live server from VScode works too since the main.js is updated automaticly)
